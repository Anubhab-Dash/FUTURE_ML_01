🧠 AI-Powered Sales Forecast Dashboard



This repository contains my internship project where I developed an AI-driven sales forecasting dashboard using \*\*Power BI\*\* and predictive analytics techniques. The dashboard visualizes retail sales trends, predicts future demand, and provides actionable insights using KPIs and AI-generated forecasts.

🧠 **Forecasting Approach**



| Step | Description |

|------|-------------|

| 📦 Data | Cleaned and transformed retail dataset with date, price, sales, and stock |

| 🧮 Model | Time series / ML model trained to predict future sales |

| 📏 Metrics | MAPE and Forecast Accuracy % used to validate model |

| 📐 DAX | Custom calculations in Power BI for KPI metrics and logic |

📈 **Results Summary**



| Metric             | Value       |

|--------------------|-------------|

| Forecast Accuracy  | 85.08%      |

| MAPE               | 14.92%      |

| Total Orders       | 10,250+     |

| Data Range         | 2014 - 2016 |
